# Fork of L-C-C SMW image

I needed a basic file to provide an SMW setup. This is a fork of the SMW ansible scripts that [Linux Competence Center](http://www.linux-competence-center.ch/Informatikl%25F6sungen/Semantic-MediaWiki.htm) published at [github](https://github.com/LinuxCompetenceCenter/ch.l-c-c.standard-smw.packer).

I'm trying to write something here that an ansible n00b can use.
